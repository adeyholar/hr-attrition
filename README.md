Detailed Architecture: Beginner Attrition Prevention Agent
System Overview
[Data Sources] → [Data Processing] → [Risk Assessment] → [Decision Engine] → [Action Handler] → [Feedback Loop]
Component Breakdown
1. Data Sources Layer
Employee Database (Mock/CSV)
•	Employee ID, Name, Department, Manager
•	Hire Date, Current Role, Salary Band
•	Performance Ratings (Last 3 reviews)
•	Absence Records (Days taken, patterns)
Data Format Example:
employee_id, name, department, manager_email, hire_date, performance_score, absence_days_30d, absence_days_90d
EMP001, John Doe, Engineering, manager1@company.com, 2022-01-15, 3.2, 2, 8
2. Data Processing Engine
Data Ingestion Module
•	Scheduled data pulls (daily/weekly)
•	Data validation and cleaning
•	Historical data storage
Feature Engineering
•	Calculate tenure (months since hire)
•	Performance trend analysis (improving/declining)
•	Absence rate calculations
•	Risk factor scoring
3. Risk Assessment Engine
Simple Scoring Algorithm (Phase 1)
python
def calculate_risk_score(employee):
    risk_score = 0
    
    # Tenure risk (higher risk for new and very long tenure)
    if employee['tenure_months'] < 6:
        risk_score += 30
    elif employee['tenure_months'] > 60:
        risk_score += 20
    
    # Performance risk
    if employee['performance_score'] < 2.5:
        risk_score += 40
    
    # Absence risk
    if employee['absence_days_30d'] > 3:
        risk_score += 20
    
    return min(risk_score, 100)
4. Decision Engine (Rule-Based)
Risk Categories:
•	High Risk: Score ≥ 70
•	Medium Risk: Score 40-69
•	Low Risk: Score < 40
Decision Rules:
python
def decide_action(employee, risk_score):
    if risk_score >= 70:
        return "immediate_manager_alert"
    elif risk_score >= 40:
        return "schedule_check_in"
    else:
        return "monitor_only"
5. Action Handler
Alert System
•	Email notifications to managers
•	Dashboard alerts for HR
•	Automated scheduling requests
Action Templates:
python
alert_templates = {
    "immediate_manager_alert": {
        "subject": "Employee Retention Alert - {employee_name}",
        "message": "Employee {employee_name} has been flagged as high attrition risk. Risk factors: {risk_factors}. Recommended actions: Schedule 1-on-1 meeting within 48 hours."
    }
}

Database (SQLite for simplicity)
sql
-- Employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    manager_email TEXT,
    hire_date DATE,
    current_performance REAL,
    status TEXT
);

    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id TEXT,
    assessment_date DATE,
    risk_score INTEGER,
    risk_factors TEXT,
    action_taken TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees (id)
);

-- Actions log table
CREATE TABLE actions_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id TEXT,
    action_type TEXT,
    action_date DATE,
    status TEXT,
    manager_response TEXT
);
Data Flow Process
Daily Execution Cycle
1.	Data Collection (9:00 AM) 
o	Pull latest employee data
o	Update absence records
o	Refresh performance scores
2.	Risk Assessment (9:30 AM) 
o	Calculate risk scores for all employees
o	Identify score changes from previous day
o	Flag new high-risk employees
3.	Decision Making (10:00 AM) 
o	Apply decision rules
o	Determine required actions
o	Generate action queue
4.	Action Execution (10:15 AM) 
o	Send manager alerts
o	Update dashboard
o	Log all actions taken
5.	Monitoring (Throughout day) 
o	Track email opens/responses
o	Monitor manager actions
o	Update employee status
Phase 1 Implementation (Weeks 1-2)
Week 1: Basic Infrastructure
•	Set up Python environment
•	Create SQLite database
•	Build data ingestion module
•	Implement basic risk scoring
Week 2: Action System
•	Build email notification system
•	Create simple dashboard
•	Implement logging system
•	Test with sample data
Phase 2 Enhancements (Weeks 3-4)
Advanced Risk Factors
•	Manager relationship quality
•	Career progression stagnation
•	Compensation competitiveness
•	Team dynamics indicators
Intelligent Actions
•	Personalized intervention recommendations
•	Timing optimization (best time to intervene)
•	Multi-channel communication (email, Slack, Teams)
Sample Configuration File
python
# config/settings.py
RISK_THRESHOLDS = {
    'HIGH': 70,
    'MEDIUM': 40,
    'LOW': 0
}

EMAIL_CONFIG = {
    'smtp_server': 'smtp.company.com',
    'port': 587,
    'username': 'hr-system@company.com'
}

SCHEDULING = {
    'daily_run_time': '09:00',
    'data_retention_days': 365
}
This architecture provides a solid foundation that can grow from a simple rule-based system to a sophisticated AI-powered solution.
